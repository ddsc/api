DDSC Lizard API
###########################

`Lizard <http://lizard.org>`_ is a framework for showing water-related
information in a web interface. We build most of what's now Lizard in the
`Python <http://python.org>`_ web framework `Django
<http://djangoproject.com>`_. We're now separating the various bits and
pieces more formally with a `REST
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer>`_ web
API.

A REST API means you can tie in easier into Lizard with your own software
instead of buying into Lizard's whole Python and Django stack.
This REST API is now build specifically for the webclient of the DDSC project.
